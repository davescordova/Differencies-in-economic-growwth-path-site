    <h3>New institutions: Transports (highways)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li style="text-align: justify;">Highways served to provide connections between regions, allowing for the replacement of old practices with newer capitalistic ones and eroding the previous isolation that was a chronic challenge to Mato Grossoâ€™s economy.</li>
        <li style="text-align: justify;">The relationship between the highways and the Land Market is plotted below.</li>

        <li style="text-align: justify;">The transport infrastructure created a structure of axes and a central hub:
            <ul>
                <li style="text-align: justify;"><b>BR-163:</b> This highway connects to more highways than any other in Mato Grosso, forming a hub.</li>
                <li style="text-align: justify;">Colonization projects along BR-163, as well as BR-070 and BR-158, have greater opportunities for growth.</li>
                <li style="text-align: justify;">These improved growth chances can be reflected in the rates of economic growth.</li>
